## Wheel of Fortune
* Took the ROM, dumped the section of data that had the puzzles. 
* Used this [this page](https://www.zophar.net/forums/showthread.php?t=14547#5) to get a head start on the encoding used to separate puzzles.
* Ended up with [all the puzzles](WOF/allPuzzles.txt)
* Script used to convert ROM bytes to puzzle list, [written in M](WOF/puzzleScript).
