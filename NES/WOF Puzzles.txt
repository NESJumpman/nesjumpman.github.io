DON'T ROCK THE BOAT
ON THE UP AND UP
THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT
THERE'S PLENTY FOR EVERYBODY
DON'T FORGET TO READ THE FINE PRINT
IT'S THE NEXT BEST THING TO BEING THERE
DON'T BE A BACK SEAT DRIVER
TIME IS MONEY
TOO MANY COOKS SPOIL THE BROTH
MANY ARE CALLED BUT FEW ARE CHOSEN
PRIDE GOETH BEFORE THE FALL
IT COMES AND GOES
IT'S ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG
FOR THE MAN WHO HAS EVERYTHING
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE
DON'T START SOMETHING YOU CAN'T FINISH
IT'S THE LAW OF THE LAND
LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE
TAKING IT EASY
DON'T BITE THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU
LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE CROSSING
DON'T SPEND IT ALL IN ONE PLACE
OUT TO LUNCH
TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING
PERISH THE THOUGHT
YOU CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU
GOOD TABLE MANNERS
EVERY LITTLE BIT COUNTS
MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A MOLEHILL
THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING
SOME GUYS HAVE ALL THE LUCK
DON'T JUMP THE GUN
THE MEANING IS LOST IN THE TRANSLATION
IT'S JUST WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE
NOW THAT THE SHOE IS ON THE OTHER FOOT
OVERLY EXCITED
CLOSED FOR REMODELING
RIPE FOR THE PICKING
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU'D HEARD EVERYTHING
FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE
PLAYING FOR KEEPS
MY BACK'S AGAINST THE WALL
TURN THE OTHER CHEEK
HITTING BELOW THE BELT
I'M HOLDING MY OWN
UNDER THE WEATHER
NOT ON YOUR LIFE
THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY
NEVER SAY NEVER
SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY
WITHIN A BLINK OF AN EYE
DON'T LOOK BACK
THERE'S A SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE
NEVER AT A LOSS FOR WORDS
LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL
ON COMMON GROUND
TOO LITTLE TOO LATE
THIRD RATE ROMANCE
TAKEN FOR GRANTED
NOT TOO BAD UNDER THE CONDITIONS
HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON
EARN WHILE YOU LEARN
HELPFUL HINT
WINNER AND STILL CHAMPION
NOTHING BUT THE FACTS
ALL OR NOTHING
EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING
LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT
A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH
BLOWING HOT AND COLD
OPENING UP A CAN OF WORMS
TWIDDLING YOUR THUMBS
HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY
BURSTING AT THE SEAMS
SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE
FLICK OF THE WRIST
A NEW BROOM SWEEPS CLEAN
WISH YOU WERE HERE
GETTING DOWN TO BRASS TACKS
NEAT AS A PIN
HIGH JINKS
THE SOONER THE BETTER
EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK
TAKE THE BULL BY THE HORNS
DOUBLE OR NOTHING
CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME
TAKE A BREAK
TAKE IT AS IT COMES
TOO MUCH TOO SOON
SEEING IS BELIEVING
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT
BLOOD IS THICKER THAN WATER
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
EVERY DOG HAS ITS DAY
SEVEN COME ELEVEN
SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT UNSAID
MAKE ME AN OFFER
CLOSE COVER BEFORE STRIKING
KEEP YOUR GUARD UP
NO LAUGHING MATTER
SOME PEOPLE NEVER LEARN
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP
BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL
DON'T COUNT ON IT
BY THE GRACE OF GOD
LEAVE IT BE
ON CLOUD NINE
UNDER THE TABLE
DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
MAYBE SO AND MAYBE NOT
AT THE CROSSROADS
TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT
OVER-THE- COUNTER
IN THE DOGHOUSE
MY TWO CENTS WORTH
OVER THE HILL
BRINGING UP THE REAR
THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK
COMING OF AGE
THE MORE THE MERRIER
THE LAST PLACE YOU'D THINK OF
HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS
GO TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS
IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
RETURN TO SENDER
I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE
THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT
THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL
HOLD THE PHONE
ON THE RAZOR'S EDGE
LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS
STOP THE PRESSES
THE WORM HAS TURNED
NO USE CRYING OVER SPILLED MILK
CASH AND CARRY
CRIME DOESN'T PAY
BOY MEETS GIRL
NOTHING BUT THE BEST
THE GOLDEN RULE
ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER
KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP
HE WHO LAUGHS LAST
ON THE RIGHT TRACK
SECOND TO NONE
IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND
DON'T TAKE ANY WOODEN NICKELS
SO BE IT
LET'S MAKE A DAY OF IT
LOOK IT UP
THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST
IT'S OPEN FOR DISCUSSION
THE JOKE'S ON YOU
THE BUCK STOPS HERE
STANDING ROOM ONLY
RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES
GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN
THE TIME IS NOW
THE CREAM ALWAYS RISES TO THE TOP
MY CUP RUNNETH OVER
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
YOU CAN BANK ON IT
OVER AND OUT
YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD ON IT
LIFE IS FOR THE LIVING
LEND ME AN EAR
LONG LIVE THE KING
THERE'S NOTHING TO IT
I CAN'T GET NO RELIEF
THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY
PAUL REVERE'S RIDE
MAKE THE MOST OF IT
TALK IS CHEAP
SQUEAKY CLEAN
THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR IT
ON THE BUTTON
DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE
YOU GO YOUR WAY AND I'LL GO MINE
ONE HAND WASHES THE OTHER
IT'S BIGGER THAN THE BOTH OF US
I'LL MEET YOU HALFWAY
DON'T CALL US WE'LL CALL YOU
DON'T BITE OFF MORE THAN YOU CAN CHEW
